ggquickeda is a user-friendly application that serves as a graphical user interface for the ggplot2 and table1 packages in R. This tool is designed to provide swift data exploration and trend detection. With ggquickeda, users can effortlessly generate scatter plots, dot plots, box plots, bar plots, histograms, density plots, and summary statistics for one or multiple variables, organized by column splits, and an optional overall column. Additionally, ggquickeda introduces geoms/stats such as km, kmband, and kmticks to simplify the plotting of Kaplan-Meier Survival curves. Upon uploading data, ggquickeda automatically selects the first column for the y variable(s) and the second column for the x variable(s). It excels in handling one or more y variable(s) selections and recently added support for one or more x variable(s). Notably, ggquickeda intelligently accommodates both categorical and continuous variables, with the flexibility to adjust variable order and remove selections.
